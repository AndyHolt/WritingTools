# WritingTools

Tools and resources to help with writing.

## Aims

- Produce some tools which make writing and producing documents and letters
  straightforward, allowing me to just produce the content.
- LaTeX classes for general articles/documents, letters, sermon/talk notes,
  handouts and other useful document types (See
  [LaTeXClasses](https://github.com/AndyHolt/LaTeXClasses)).
- Workflow/Makefiles/scripts to make writing in Markdown (or perhaps Org-mode)
  and converting to LaTeX/PDF and HTML simple and straightforward.
